# ðŸŒŸ Welcome to My GitHub Profile!

As a mathematician, I delve into the essence of problems by breaking them down into basic components. Leveraging my eagerness, coding, and analytical skills, I strive to understand, solve, and optimize.

## Languages
My portfolio mainly consists of Python, with my portfolio project in javascript. Recently, I also delved deeper into C++, making a particle diffusion simulator.
